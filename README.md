# About
this project is a practice on using xml, lxml, also it aims to create custom xml file can be used for meta data 
we have got this idea from <name>.drawio which is written in xml format

# Note
i know that this project is belong to `serilzation_t` project but i decided to make standalone project because xml is special case [more difficult than other serializers]
also shall i take a copy from this projct into `serialization_t`

also remind ur self with a standard rules for writing xml structure, because if u went back in memory u would remember that `React`(https://reactjs.org/) did so i remember one of its components was like
```xml
<RDOMCreation>
    ...
</RDOMCreation>
```
